                recipe to suit your own tastes, easily edit any ingredient or
                step of the directions with the click of a button. Hit save and

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            I have been eating a vegan diet for over 5 years and I try to avoid
            tofu at all costs. Tofu seems to be <i>the</i> substitution that can
            turn any recipe vegan and that makes it difficult for me to find
            interesting and flavourful recipes. Iâ€™ve adapted many recipes from
            across the internet and needed a place to save and share them with
            friends. Food Feed was the solution!

          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            A mobile-first design was crucial as the intended audience is a user
            reading the recipe off their smartphones while cooking. The layout
            is clear and simple, with snap scrolling it is easily navigable by
            pinky finger, so that the user minimizes the handling of their
            device.

            <h3>Issues faced</h3>
            <p>
              Designing a simple layout with high-functionality was a big task
              to overcome. The end user experience was always at top of mind as
              being able to easily follow the recipe was the most important
              feature.
            </p>
            <p>
              I created the API of recipes over several iterations. Being able
              to link particular ingredients to a specific direction required
              using multiple array methods and nesting arrays within arrays of
              objects.
